You have      an obligation to change it. You just do it one step at a time.&quot; -      Marian Wright Edelman </h2>    <h2>WHAT IS THIS EXPERTISE? WHY DOES IT MATTER? </h2>    <blockquote>       <p>Results are what we all want to achieve &ndash; positive measurable        evidence that what we are doing to improve the lives of others is working!&nbsp; We        seek success, and we need to know when we&rsquo;ve attained it!&nbsp; As        we work to improve social conditions that seem intractable, results are        often difficult to characterize and track. Results in the field of social        change are complex, affected by myriad factors, and not immediately apparent.        Achieving results is a long-term process. Yet it is important and increasingly        feasible to articulate desired results for improving social conditions.</p>      <p> Informational resources on achieving measurable results are readily        available in private sector literature on management, productivity, and        profit.&nbsp; However,        the movement toward &ldquo;evidence-based&rdquo; practice, results-oriented        decision making, and results-based grantmaking is in a relatively nascent        stage of development in the public and independent sectors.&nbsp; Strategies,        tools, and mechanisms for articulating and documenting progress toward        fulfilling the goals of an initiative are being crafted by those in the        nonprofit world who recognize the value of demonstrating how interventions        improve outcomes for individuals, communities, and society as a whole.</p>      The T. L. Hill Group facilitates members of nonprofit organizations, philanthropic      institutions, and partnerships interested in affecting social change in      clarifying desired results for their initiatives and identifying milestones    along with strategies for attaining them.</blockquote>    <h2>TYPES OF PRODUCTS  </h2>    <blockquote>      <p>All projects undertaken by the T. L. Hill Group are customized.&nbsp; As        a result, all products are tailored to meet the expectations specified        in a scope of work negotiated with each client.&nbsp; No &ldquo;boiler        plate&rdquo; formats are used.&nbsp; Therefore, in lieu of product templates,        the T. L. Hill Group is able to share the examples below listed of products        completed to date.&nbsp; Any new work would result in a product uniquely        designed to meet particular needs of the client. </p>      <ul>        <li><strong><em>Results Frameworks</em></strong> engage partners from          diverse disciplines and sectors in developing strategies and achieving          results.</li>        <li><strong><em>Managing by Results </em></strong> involves using a commonly          developed frame of reference and accompanying management tools with          multiple partners to ensure that every contributor stays focused on          the desired outcomes for an initiative. </li>        <li><em><strong>Results-based Decision Making </strong></em> is a process          that engages multiple partners in using a logic model to clarify underlying          assumptions, articulate the rationale for pursuing particular courses          of action, and utilize information - qualitative and quantitative -          to determine the optimal course of action when confronted with choices. </li>      </ul>    </blockquote>	<h2>CLIENTS who have tapped into this expertise <br />    </h2>	<blockquote>		A select group of projects implemented by the T.
