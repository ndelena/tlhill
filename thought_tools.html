Results in the field of        social change are complex, affected by myriad factors, and not immediately        apparent. Achieving results is a long-term process. Yet it is important        and increasingly feasible to articulate desired results for improving        social conditions. The T. L. Hill Group facilitates members of organizations        interested in affecting social change in clarifying desired results for        their initiatives and identifying milestones along with strategies for      attaining them.</p>    </blockquote>    <h2>Issue-Centered Strategies </h2>    <blockquote>      <p>Social change initiatives often integrate multiple aims and partners.        As these initiatives grow in complexity, it becomes increasingly beneficial        to unite layers of people and organizations around a set of strategies        that create a &quot;least common denominator&quot; - a unifying principle        or action around which various tasks can be organized. By finding issue-centered        strategies, several partners in a multifaceted initiative can find ways        to connect and add value based on their respective expertise. The T.        L. Hill Group works with members of client organizations to identify        compelling issues and think creatively about how they might be strategically        considered for a variety of activities, including developing messages      that highlight an organization's accomplishments.</p>    </blockquote>	<h2>Environmental Scanning <br />    </h2>	<blockquote>		In the field of social change, information is constantly expanding. Our		  knowledge of what works to improve access to jobs for low skilled workers		  or what it takes to help five-year-olds enter school ready to learn improves		  with each new strategy. Whether we learn what to do or what not to do, the		  knowledge base grows with each effort. Information about the issues we address		  may be traced to numerous sources ranging from academic journals to periodicals		  and recently released news not yet published. The purpose of environmental		  scanning is to conduct a systematic search for knowledge that might inform		  or otherwise enhance our understanding of the issue we are addressing. This		  practice is widely used by private sector firms to remain competitive. The		  T. L. Hill Group constructs environmental scans with members of client organizations		  in an effort to transfer this skill while uncovering meaningful information	    as part of the scan.</blockquote>  </div></div><!--end content --><div id="navBar"><div class="suckerdiv"><ul id="suckertree1"><li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li><li><a href="about_us.html">About Us</a></li><li><a href="#">Expertise</a>  <ul>  <li><a href="exp1.html">Gathering, Analyzing & Synthesizing Information for Decisions</a></li>  <li><a href="exp2.html">Facilitating & Managing Partnerships</a></li>  <li><a href="exp3.html">Designing Results Frameworks</a></li>  <li><a href="exp4.html">Writing about the Work</a></li>  <li><a href="exp5.html">Speaking, Presenting & Moderating Events</a></li>  </ul></li><li><a href="thought_tools.html">Thought-Tools</a></li><li><a href="clients.html">Clients</a></li><li><a href="collaborators.html">Collaborators</a></li><li><a href="contact_us.html">Contact Us</a></li></ul></div> <!--end navbar --><div id="siteInfo"> <a href="#">Site Map</a> | &copy;2007 T.
