WHY DOES IT MATTER? </h2>    <blockquote>       <p>Social change initiatives often integrate multiple aims and partners.&nbsp; Partnerships        reflect a delicate balance of shared interests, diverse but interrelated        expertise, and commonly held commitments to work together on an enterprise.&nbsp; Every        partnership represents a unique constellation of individuals, organizations,        and institutions.&nbsp; They are composed of partners who bring their        own perspectives, cultures, and experiences to transact business in a        mutually constituted forum.&nbsp; As partnerships and initiatives grow        in complexity, it becomes increasingly beneficial to unite layers of        people and organizations around a set of strategies that create a &quot;least        common denominator&quot; - a unifying principle or action around which        various tasks can be organized. By finding issue-centered strategies,        several partners in a multifaceted initiative can find ways to connect        and add value based on their respective expertise.&nbsp; Partnerships        operate for a period of time deemed appropriate for accomplishing a common        mission &ndash; perhaps forever, perhaps for six months.&nbsp; The results        of the work undertaken by partnerships will be as high quality and relevant      as the partners decide it will be.</p>      <p>Partnerships are not organizations.&nbsp; A wealth of informational        resources and instructional materials exist about organizations &ndash; for        profit and nonprofit.&nbsp; However valuable the lessons from organizational        change and management literature may be, they do not take into account        the particular context and structure of partnerships.&nbsp; Not surprisingly,        public funders and philanthropic institutions are responsible for fostering        the greatest number of partnerships aimed at improving societal outcomes.&nbsp; Through        requests for collaboration and partnership embedded in funding criteria        or through the natural evolution of networks within the social change        fields, an experience base exists.&nbsp; However, it is sporadically        documented and not as readily accessible as the extensive literature        base on organizations.</p>      The T. L. Hill Group recognizes the unique value and contributions of partnerships      and draws upon information from several disciplines to customize approaches      and design tools that match the needs of a particular partnership.&nbsp; We      work with members of client organizations to identify compelling issues      and think creatively about how they might be strategically considered for      a variety of activities, including developing messages that highlight a      partnership's accomplishments.    </blockquote>    <h2>TYPES OF PRODUCTS  </h2>    <blockquote>      <p>All projects undertaken by the T. L. Hill Group are customized.&nbsp; As        a result, all products are tailored to meet the expectations specified        in a scope of work negotiated with each client.&nbsp; No &ldquo;boiler        plate&rdquo; formats are used.&nbsp; Therefore, in lieu of product templates,        the T. L. Hill Group is able to share the examples below listed of products        completed to date.&nbsp; Any new work would result in a product uniquely        designed to meet particular needs of the client. </p>      <ul>        <li><strong><em>Integrated Solutions</em></strong> engage partners from          diverse disciplines and sectors in developing strategies and achieving          results.</li>        <li><strong><em>Implementation Frameworks</em></strong> allow partners          to map and track progress toward achieving goals.</li>        <li><em><strong>Conference/Meeting Decision Summaries</strong></em> provide          partners with a concise report of decisions made during a conference          or meeting, including brief listings of key issues and discussion points.          These summaries, unlike minutes of a meeting, are used for managing          the work and keeping the desired results foremost.</li>      </ul>    </blockquote>	<h2>CLIENTS who have tapped into this expertise <br />    </h2>	<blockquote>		A select group of projects implemented by the T.
