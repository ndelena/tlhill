WHY DOES IT MATTER? </h2>    <blockquote>       <p>When it is time to determine where the work has led us, what it means,        and where to go from there, it is important to take time for reflection.        Considering what has been learned and figuring out how thoughtfully to        apply those insights for charting future courses of action are critical        acts undertaken by every nonprofit organization and philanthropic institution      at important moments in the evolution of an initiative.</p>      <p>In the field of social change, information is constantly expanding.        Our knowledge of what works to improve access to jobs for low skilled        workers or what it takes to help five-year-olds enter school ready to        learn improves with each new strategy. Whether we learn what to do or        what <u>not</u> to do, the knowledge base grows with each effort. Information        about the issues we address may be traced to numerous sources ranging        from academic journals to periodicals and recently released news not        yet published. Practices like environmental scanning enable an organization        or partnership to conduct a systematic search for knowledge that might        inform or otherwise enhance the group&rsquo;s understanding of the issue        it aims to address. </p>      <p>The T. L. Hill Group assists nonprofit and philanthropic organizations        in gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information for use by its        members in making decisions about how the work needs to advance.&nbsp; We        often are our own best sources of information.&nbsp; Whether a group        has compiled quantitative and qualitative data about an initiative and        seeks to sort through findings and implications or is interested in collecting        a range of types of information that would inform the design of an internal        study, an informal research project, or a formal evaluation, the T. L.        Hill Group is able to assist.&nbsp; <br />          <br />        Areas of expertise include improving vulnerable young adult transitions,        implementing multicultural strategies, designing human resource solutions        that match your organization's needs. </p>    </blockquote>    <h2>TYPES OF PRODUCTS  </h2>    <blockquote>      <p>All projects undertaken by the T. L. Hill Group are customized.&nbsp; As        a result, all products are tailored to meet the expectations specified        in a scope of work negotiated with each client.&nbsp; No &ldquo;boiler        plate&rdquo; formats are used.&nbsp; Therefore, in lieu of product templates,        the T. L. Hill Group is able to share the examples below listed of products        completed to date.&nbsp; Any new work would result in a product uniquely        designed to meet particular needs of the client.</p>    </blockquote>	<ul>	  <li><strong><em>Internal Reports </em></strong> that capture the perspectives	    of various partners in an initiative and offer guidance for addressing	    specific issues.</li>      <li><strong><em>Environmental Scanning Tools </em></strong> that facilitate        information gathering by your staff and stakeholders to explore new areas        of interest.</li>	  <li><em><strong>Issue Summaries </strong></em> provide an overview, key concepts,	    challenges, and options for action.   </li>	</ul>	<h2>CLIENTS who have tapped into this expertise <br />    </h2>	<blockquote>		A select group of projects implemented by the T. L. Hill Group which		  demonstrate skill in gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information		  for decisions is below listed.		  <ul>		  <li><strong>The Ford Foundation</strong>: <em>Funders Network on Population,		      Reproductive Health &amp; Rights, Women of Color Working Group (<a href="http://www.fundersnet.org">http://www.fundersnet.org</a>),		      Collaborative Fund Project. </em>Produced a report on how to design a		      new collaborative fund based on interviews and information gathered		      on more than six major philanthropic funds. The Women of Color		      Working Group used the report to design components of a new fund		      and to determine the efficacy of launching a new fund. (June 2005		      through March 2006)</li>          <li><strong>Management Assistance Group</strong> (<a href="http://www.managementassistance.org">http://www.managementassistance.org</a>): <em>Society              of American Law Teachers (<a href="http://www.saltlaw.org">http://www.saltlaw.org</a>) - Committee              Chair Interviews and Synthesis</em>. As a subcontractor to the Management              Assistance Group, interviewed ten Committee Chairs within the Society              of American Law Teachers to determine how their responsibilities,              work products, and future projects would affect internal deliberation              regarding how to meet the organization's staffing needs. (April              2006) </li>		  <li><strong>Council on African American Affairs</strong> (<a href="http://www.africanamericanaffairs.org">http://www.africanamericanaffairs.org</a>): <em>Summer		      Research Fellows Program</em>. Conducted a summer program with research		      fellows to engage them in an environmental scanning project to		      recommend to the Board of Trustees a strategic direction for the		      Council's inaugural policy initiative. Recommendations presented		      by the research fellows were approved by the Ron Brown Scholar		      Alumni and by the Council on African American Affairs Board of		      Trustees. (June through August 2002).  </li>		  <li><strong>National Youth Employment Coalition</strong> (<a href="http://www.nyec.org">http://www.nyec.org</a>): <em>Issue		      Area Strategy</em>. Facilitated the development of an issue area strategy		      based on a review of the National Youth Employment Coalition's		      (NYEC) three-year plan and consultation with NYEC staff members		      with periodic review by the Board. (February 2002 through December		      2003).  </li>	    </ul>	</blockquote>	<h2>SAMPLE OF PRIOR WORK <br />    </h2>	<blockquote>		The T. L.
